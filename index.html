            <h1>Apache Server Installation and Cloud Deployment Project</h1>
              <p> In this project, I successfully demonstrated my technical skills by installing and configuring an Apache server within a virtual machine and subsequently deploying it to a cloud environment. The steps involved in this process are as follows:

                Virtual Machine Setup: I initiated the project by installing an Ubuntu Linux virtual machine on VirtualBox/VMware. I personalized the system by setting the hostname to my first name and last ID.
                
                Network Configuration: Enabled network settings and verified the IP address using the ifconfig command to ensure connectivity.
                
                Apache Installation: Installed the Apache package and started its service, transforming the virtual machine into a functioning web server.
                
                Web Page Creation: Developed a simple web page featuring profiles of my group members. This page was saved and tested locally via localhost.
                
                Local IP Access: Ensured accessibility by opening the website through the machine's IP address, confirming that the server was operational.
                
                Cloud Deployment: Migrated the Apache server to a cloud service provider, choosing between AWS, GCP, or Azure, for its robust capabilities. Configured the instance to run Apache and made it publicly accessible.
                
                Public Access: Tested the deployment by accessing the web page through the public cloud IP address, confirming successful deployment.
                
                Throughout this project, I meticulously documented each step and captured screenshots, demonstrating my capability in both virtual and cloud environments. This project not only highlights my technical proficiency in server management and cloud computing but also showcases my ability to execute a project from start to finish with precision and attention to detail.

            <h1>Team Collaboration on Apache Server Installation and Deployment</h1>
              <p> ok now i have three group members which equaly contribute yo acomplish this project write a pergraph on it first is zohiab muneer and second is Hamid nawaz third is unknown person
                Team Collaboration on Apache Server Installation and Deployment
                This project was a great demonstration of teamwork and collective effort. Alongside my dedicated group members, Zohaib Muneer, Hamid Nawaz, and a third unnamed contributor, we successfully completed the installation and deployment of an Apache server.
                
                Zohaib Muneer played a pivotal role in setting up the virtual machine and configuring the network settings, ensuring that our system was up and running smoothly. Hamid Nawaz took charge of the Apache installation and the creation of the web page, displaying great attention to detail to make sure our content was both functional and visually appealing. Our third group member provided essential support in deploying the server to the cloud and configuring it for public access, ensuring the project was accessible from anywhere.
                
                Each member contributed equally, bringing their unique skills to the table, which made the entire process seamless and efficient. This project not only highlighted our individual technical capabilities but also underscored the strength of our collaboration and effective communication. Together, we achieved our goal and successfully transitioned our Apache server from a local setup to a cloud deployment, proving that teamwork truly makes the dream work. </p>
